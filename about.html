<h1>About Me</h1>
<img src="hayden.jpg" align="right" width="500">
<p>My name is Hayden Blair, I am a junior at Michgian State University studying Information Science. I really enjoy working with technology, and hope to one day have a career in collegiate sports technology. Some of my other interests include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Gambling</li>
	<li>Hiking/Being Outdoor</li>
	<li>Travelling</li>
</ul>
<p>Outside of these things, I spend a lot of my time raising dogs for Leader Dogs for the Blind, and non-profit based out of Rochester. They facilitate the training and placement of service dogs with visually impaired people, and it has been super rewarding to be a part of that process. I raise dogs from 8 weeks old to about a year and a half, then return them to the Leader Dog campus in Rochester for further training and placement.</p>
