	<h2>Vaccine Requirement at MSU</h2>

    <p>Due to surging COVID-19 numbers, MSU has mandated the COVID-19 vaccine for all students and staff. While there are limited exceptions for religious and medical reasons, the vast majority of Spartans will be required to have the vaccine in order to participate in on-campus activities. This has been met with little opposition, as MSU now reports over 95% of individuals have been vaccinated. There has yet to be a major outbreak on MSU's campus, thanks to the agressive vaccine policy and the continued mask mandate.</p>
    
    <p>One major flaw with MSU vaccine reporting system is the lack of any safeguards to prevent people from lying about vaccination status. The only information you are required to give is the date of both doses, and there is nothing to prevent people from lying about their status. The requirement of a vaccine card, or even the lot numbers of the batch you recieved, would go a long way to ensure people are reporting correctly.</p>

	<h2>Kellogg plant workers still on strike</h2>
    <h3>By Hayden Blair</h3>
    <h4>Published 10/13/21</h4>

    <p>Kellogg plant workers in Battle Creek continue to strike as their contract has expired. The BCTGM, the union that represents them, has yet to resume negotiations with Kellogg. As workers now start to feel the effects of no paycheck, the BCTGM has encouraged its members to pick up jobs on the side to help the resist crossing the line and returning to work. The BCTGM has claimed that Kellogg has threatened to move ready-to-eat cereal production outside of the country in response to the strike, which Kellogg has denied.</p>
    
    <p>The BCTGM says they want fair living wages and benefits. The disagreement is mostly due to a previously agreed upon system where new employees were hired into a transitional group, and were then moved to the legacy group after a while with better pay and benefits. Kellogg wants to do away with this system, and while it would mean wage increases for all workers, the union claims it would prevent new employees from reaching the same wage levels as veteran workers.</p>
